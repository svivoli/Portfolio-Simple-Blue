### User Experience

The top of the page contains a title and subtitle and a hamburger navigation toggler over a background image of me. The hamburger toggler contains and directs the user to the different sections of the page.

[Intro and Skills](https://i.imgur.com/HtQAYGt.png)

The first section is an intro section that contains a short bio. The following section is a skills section that lists the skills I am obtaining in the boot camp. Each is displayed with a fontawesome icon inside of a circular div. The two sections have slightly different background colors since they are directly next to one another.

[Credentials](https://i.imgur.com/fWs6Vtc.jpg)

The following section has the title "More of my credentials." It lists my education and has an icon that is linked to my resume via google docs. This section is split into two, the left side being an image of a desk. Below the credentials section is a short parallax section with a link to the UO boot camp website.

The next section hosts my projects. They are displayed in a slider, with three projects per page. Each project is displayed with an image that is animated when hovered over and can be clicked to access the live project in a new tab. There is also a title and description beneath each one. Below the section is a small dark section with a back to top button.

[Profiles](https://i.imgur.com/aIpL5dL.png)

The next section contains my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Heroku profile information. Each is displayed with a fontawesome icon, title, description, and link icon that takes the user to the profile in a new tab.

[Contact](https://i.imgur.com/yLbnBlL.png)

After a parallax section of a desk is the last section which contains contact information. Here, my email address and phone number are displayed in separate cards and linked icons to email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and my resume lie below. At the bottom of the page there is a dark footer with legal links and credit to Codrops.
